            <h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Chemistry</h2>
            <p>Chemistry is a science which focuses on the study of matter.</p>
            <p>There are three main branches of Science:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Natural Science</li>
                <li>Social Science</li>
                <li>Formal Science</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Natural Science refers to the study of the physical world and universe. Chemistry, along with Physics and Biology, are Natural Sciecnes.</p>
            <h2 id="chemistry_and_society">Chemistry and Society</h2>
            <p>Chemistry is often referred to as the central science because it joins together physics and mathematics, biology and medicine, and the earth and environmental sciences. It plays a role in everyone's lives and touches almost every aspect of our existence in some way. Chemistry is essential for meeting our basic needs of food, clothing, shelter, health, energy, and clean air, water, and soil. Chemical technologies enrich our quality of life in numerous ways by providing new solutions to problems in health, materials, and energy usage.</p>
            <p>A chemist is someone who performs research regarding chemicals and may often teach courses regarding the subject matter. The behavior of atoms, molecules, and ions determines the sort of world we live in, our shapes and sizes, and our moods and emotions. Chemists who understand these phenomena are very well equipped to tackle problems faced by our modern society. Such problems include sustainable energy, food production, managing our environment, providing safe drinking water and promoting human and environmental health.</p>
